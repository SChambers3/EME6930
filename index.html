<p>I received a BA in Linguistics from Brigham Young University in 2004 and a Teaching English to Students of Other Languages (TESOL) certificate from Brigham Young University Idaho in 2018. I am currently a Learning Design and Technology masterâ€™s student at the University of South Florida with a concentration in E-Learning Design and Development.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my husband and our six children. Much of my spare time is spent in preparing and teaching for our home school. When I do get personal time, I like to draw, paint, read, play soccer, and eat KitKats.</p>
